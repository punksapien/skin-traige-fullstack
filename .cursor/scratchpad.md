# Skin Triage Microservice Project

## Background and Motivation
Building a "skin-triage" microservice that accepts images and returns classification (acne or other) with confidence levels. Using turborepo monorepo structure with FastAPI backend and a pre-trained EfficientNet PyTorch model.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- Setting up proper monorepo structure with Turborepo
- Creating a FastAPI service that can load and use the PyTorch model
- Dockerizing the application for deployment to fly.io
- Creating appropriate interfaces between the model and API

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. Initialize turborepo layout with apps/api, apps/web, packages/model ✅
2. Set up Python environment with Poetry for the API ✅
3. Create model loader utility in packages/model ✅
4. Create FastAPI endpoint for image classification ✅
5. Set up Docker and docker-compose configuration ✅
6. Create fly.io deployment configuration ✅
7. Write documentation and examples ✅

## Project Status Board
- [x] Initialize the directory structure
- [x] Move model file to appropriate location
- [x] Create Python project with Poetry
- [x] Implement model loader utility
- [x] Implement FastAPI endpoints
- [x] Create Docker configuration
- [x] Set up docker-compose
- [x] Create fly.io deployment config
- [x] Write README with documentation

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
All tasks have been completed! The project now has:
- A proper monorepo structure with Turborepo
- A FastAPI backend that can classify skin images
- A model package that loads and uses the pre-trained EfficientNet model
- Docker and docker-compose configuration for local development
- fly.io deployment configuration
- Complete documentation

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
All tasks have been completed according to the requirements. To finalize the setup, we should:
1. Test the API locally
2. Make sure the model loads correctly
3. Deploy the application to fly.io if required

## Lessons
- Keep Docker images lean by using multi-stage builds where appropriate
- Ensure relative paths are handled correctly for model loading
- Document API endpoints thoroughly
- When working with Poetry and local packages, make sure to have proper package structure with __init__.py files
